# ThinkPad-X240-WINDOWS-LINUX-APPLE
 
Updates:
- Looks that all works with new Clover, but you have to update manualy without specific drivers  
- Sinetek-rtsx.kext v2.2 (now SD card reader don't breaks transfer) 

MacOS Mojave Issues:
- touchPad (sometimes not loaded) 
- card reader stops working on second standby with card inserted (Jettison app doesn't help) 
- Audio (minijack) restarts on standby (look for alc_fix, will be updated soon) 
- only Wi-fi (on 3G) or Bluetooth at the same time (DW1820A) due to interferations (5G works fine)
